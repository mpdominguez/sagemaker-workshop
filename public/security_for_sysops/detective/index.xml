      <description>AWS recommends a defense-in-depth approach to security, applying security at every level of your application and environment. In this section we will focus on the concept of detective controls and incident response in the form of a corrective control. A detective control is responsible for identifying potential security threats or incidents while a corrective control is responsible for limiting the potential damage of the threat or incident after detection.
One example of a form of detective control is the use of internal auditing to ensure that an environment and user practice is inline with your policies and requirements.</description>

      <title>Lab 4: Detective and Corrective Controls</title>

      <description>In this lab you will test a remediating detective control that was deployed by the cloud platform engineering team in Lab 1. The control is designed to detect the creation of Amazon SageMaker training jobs outside of the secure data science VPC and terminate them. To do this, you will go through the Jupyter notebook kernel 00_SageMaker-SysOps-Workflow and execute the cells up to and including the creation of a training job.</description>
