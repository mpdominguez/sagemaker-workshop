To work through these labs you will need: 

 - **An AWS account**

     With privileges to create IAM roles, attach IAM policies, create AWS VPCs, configure Service Catalog, create Amazon S3 buckets, and work with Amazon SageMaker.

 - **Access to the [AWS web console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home)**

     Many of the instructions will guide you through working with the various service consoles.  

 - **[Jupyter cheat sheet](https://www.edureka.co/blog/cheatsheets/jupyter-notebook-cheat-sheet)**

     If you are unfamiliar with the Jupyter notebook interface or its keybindings a cheat sheet may help you navigate.

 - **Optional: AWS CLI**

     You may want to have the AWS CLI available for working with AWS services like Amazon S3.
