This lab will explore the tools available to you to create a secure environment, starting with the network.  By establishing a secure network environment you can begin to use familiar IP-level controls to manage the flow of data and access to systems.  You will learn some concepts and terms specific to AWS but should get a sense of how to create a private environment for your data science teams.  You will also create resources to encrypt data as it flows from storage in Amazon S3, into the VPC on EBS volumes, and back out to Amazon S3.

Let's get started.
