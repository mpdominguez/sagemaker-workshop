This module focuses on using your own training algorithm and your own inference code. You can use the deep learning containers provided by Amazon SageMaker for model training and your own inference code. You provide a script written for the deepV learning framework, such as Apache MXNet or TensorFlow. To proceed to this module you need to have completed the [Cloud9 Setup](../prerequisites/cloud9.html) and [Creating a Notebook Instance](../introduction/notebook.html) sections in the previous module.
