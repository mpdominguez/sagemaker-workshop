You are now connected to a Jupyter notebook server running within a secured data science environment.  From the notebook you have access to a centralized, hosted PyPI mirror and select buckets in Amazon S3.  There is no open access to the Internet or unnecessary AWS services to safeguard against data exfiltration.  Using this environment you will now work through the various stages of the machine learning lifecycle, from data exploration, through training, and finally to hosting and monitoring.
