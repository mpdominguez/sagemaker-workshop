In this module you will be introduced to the recommended practices for using Amazon SageMaker in a secure data science environment.  Like many other AWS services, Amazon SageMaker is secure by default.  Throughout this workshop you will see how you can work in a secured data science environment.  You will cover the many stages of the machine learning lifecycle and be provided with Jupyter notebooks to step through that lifecycle while maintaining a high bar for security.

Let's get started.
