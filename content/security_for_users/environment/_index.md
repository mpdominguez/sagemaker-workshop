In this module you will use AWS services to quickly deploy a secure environment for a data science project.  After deploying the environment you will also create a SageMaker notebook for use throughout the remainder of this module.

Please know that this module creates the same environment that was created in the [Building Secure Environments](/security_for_sysops.html) module.  If you have worked through that module already and have a secured data science environment, you can reuse that environment here and can skip ahead to [Secure Data Science Notebooks](/security_for_users/notebook.html).
